## Overview
Worked on fault diagnostics for motors in haptics of surgeon side console of DV-5 resulting in a new invention disclosure.
- Implemented tools for detecting the new fault in the motors from the field data.
- Developed and experimentally validated the analytical model of the motor operation under the newly diagnosed fault.
- Developed the relationship between the residual and torque loss due to fault for validating thresholds.

Also, proposed a spec change for hall sensors in a motor by validating it against motor safety algorithms and other specs on the same sensors that doubled the manufacturing process capability metric.

## Key Results
- Analytical model of the motor operation under fault that is validated using experimental data.
- A framework to determine the thresholds for residual to detect the specific fault.
- A spec proposal for improving manufacturing process capability metric.

## Technologies Used
- Hardware in loop (HIL) testing
- MATLAB (Object Oriented Programming)
- C
- SQL
- Python
