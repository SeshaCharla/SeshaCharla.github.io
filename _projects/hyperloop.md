## Overview
During my internship at **Virgin Hyperloop**, I worked on the **Cargo Pilot Project**, focusing on **levitation and guidance control**. My contributions included:
- Designing a **supervisory control** strategy to minimize force mismatches across bogies.
- Refining the **electromagnetic engine control architecture** using **MATLAB/Simulink**.
- Developing a **MIMO model** for the guidance bogie engine assembly and analyzing its robust stability.

## Key Results
- Improved **EM engine efficiency** through control optimizations.
- Demonstrated limitations of **linear control strategies** for the system.
- Created robust stability and performance models to analyze **suspension parameters**.

## Technologies Used
- MATLAB/Simulink (Data Dictionaries)
- Using look-up tables and curve fitting to approximate highly nonlinear dynamics under restrictive state and frequency constraints.
- Linear Robust Control and MIMO systems analysis
- Electromagnetic Levitation Systems
- FOC control of PMSM (phase angle estimation problem)
