## Overview and Contributions
Worked on a USDA-funded project focused on automating fat estimation in meat processing. The goal was to replace manual classification methods with a computer vision-based approach for determining the lean-to-fat (LTF) ratio in meat cuts. Contributions include:
- Developed an estimation framework to classify meat based on LTF ratios using image processing and statistical modeling.
- Implemented computer vision techniques for fat and lean segmentation using RGB and LAB color spaces.
- Built a C++ image processing pipeline for real-time estimation.
- Optimized estimation accuracy by correlating surface-level fat patterns with full-volume fat distribution.
