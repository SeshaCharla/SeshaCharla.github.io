## Overview
As a **Scientist/Engineer 'SC'** at the **Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)**, I worked on **thermal instrumentation and control** for various satellite systems, including **Chandrayaan-2**, GSAT-9,11 and INSAT series. My work spanned **sensor integration and real-time data acquisition** to optimize and automate satellite testing.

## Key Contributions
- **Led thermal instrumentation & control** for **15 satellite systems**, ensuring precision in thermal analysis and validation.
- **Developed a Python-based SCADA interface**, doubling test productivity and enabling **simultaneous satellite testing**. Github Repository: [mgco](https://github.com/SeshaCharla/mgco)
- **Created an optimal heater design software in python**, that completely eliminated saturation faults due to improper tuning and prevented heater burnout. Github Repository: [htrdsgn](https://github.com/SeshaCharla/htrdsgn)
- Developed methodologies for **in-situ weight-based heater-sensor mapping** based on the temperature rates which drastically minimized the lead time before the test start and automatically corrected for mapping errors during the tests.
- **Technology development program**: Demonstrated the use of the EPICS framework on a test setup as a proof of concept for a unified SCADA system for thermal control and sensing across all test chambers simultaneously during satellite testing.


## Technologies Used
- Instrumentation & Control Systems (PID, PI and Loop Shaping)
- SCADA Systems Development (C, Python, LabView)
- EPICS Framework (Control Systems)
- Test Automation
- Embedded Systems & Sensor Integration
