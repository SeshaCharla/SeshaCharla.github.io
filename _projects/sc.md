## Overview
During my time as a **Research Engineer Intern** at **SC Solutions**, I worked on a **USDA-funded project** focused on **automating fat estimation in meat processing**. The goal was to replace manual classification methods with a **computer vision-based approach** for determining the lean-to-fat (LTF) ratio in meat cuts.

## Key Contributions
- Developed an estimation framework to classify meat based on LTF ratios using image processing and statistical modeling.
- Implemented computer vision techniques for fat and lean segmentation using RGB and LAB color spaces.
- Built a C++ image processing pipeline for real-time estimation.
- Optimized estimation accuracy by correlating surface-level fat patterns with full-volume fat distribution.

## Key Results
- Achieved a **feasible estimation model** for LTF classification.
- Developed a **scalable C++ framework** for processing **large video datasets** efficiently.
- Enabled **automated fat estimation**, for improving consistency.
