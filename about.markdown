I am a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University, specializing in estimation theory, adaptive robust control, and fault diagnosis for nonlinear systems under uncertainty. My research and industry experience span vehicle dynamics, multivariable control, system identification, and computer vision-based estimation.

With hands-on experience at SC Solutions, Virgin Hyperloop, and ISRO, I have developed and implemented control algorithms, real-time estimation models, and robust diagnostic frameworks across automotive, aerospace, and industrial applications. My work includes:

<ul>
<li> Developing state and parameter estimation algorithms for vision-based fat estimation in the industrial food processing systems.</li>
<li> Designing supervisory control strategies to optimize electromagnetic engine efficiency at Virgin Hyperloop. </li>
<li>Leading thermal control instrumentation for satellite testing at ISRO, including Chandrayaan-2â€™s lander, orbiter, and rover. </li>
</ul>
I am passionate about bridging advanced control techniques with real-world applications, leveraging convex optimization, reinforcement learning, and system identification to solve complex engineering challenges.
