title: "Trajectory Generation of Hybrid Linear-affine Systems under Polytopic Uncertainities and Constraints"
summary: "Developed a simplex-chain generation algorithm which can be used for motion planning of hybrid linear-affine systems under polytopic uncertianities and constraints. The simplices form the sequence control-barrier functions satisfying the desired constraints."
