## Problem
- Determine the catalyst aging in-situ from the truck data.

## Objective
- A reduced order model with detectable unknowns that reflect aging with bounded uncertainty.

## Requirements:
- Identifiability
- Robustness of aging signatures and detection mechanisms

# Key Results

## Dynamic Modelling: Discrete Switched Nonlinear Model
- Two-fold prediction improvement compared to CSTR model
- Interplay between residence time and sampling
- Catalyst Saturation and Desaturation

## Parameter and State Estimation:
- Nonlinear Model that is Linear in Parameters
- Observer for catalyst storage
- Saturated system identification using linear programming.

## Aging Signatures:
- Saturated Catalyst System Parameters
- Test statistic that has statistically different mean.
