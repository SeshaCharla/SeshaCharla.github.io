I am Sesha N. Charla, a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University specializing in estimation theory, adaptive robust control, and fault diagnosis for nonlinear systems under uncertainty. My research bridges theoretical advances in control and estimation with practical engineering applications across aerospace, automotive, and medical robotics.

I have contributed to a range of projects, including:

<ul>

<li> Medical robotics (Intuitive Surgical): Developed and validated fault diagnostics for motor haptics, leading to a new invention disclosure and sensor specification improvements.

<li> Transportation (Virgin Hyperloop): Designed supervisory control strategies to improve electromagnetic engine efficiency and stability.

<li> Industrial automation (SC Solutions, USDA project): Built computer vision-based estimation models for food processing systems.

<li> Space systems (ISRO): Led thermal control instrumentation for multiple satellites, including Chandrayaan-2 orbiter, lander, and rover.

</ul>

My ongoing research explores fault diagnostics in diesel engine aftertreatment systems.

I am passionate about creating reliable, adaptive, and safe systems through advanced estimation and control techniques, and I look forward to contributing these skills to solving real-world problems in industry.
